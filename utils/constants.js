  bhaiSahibAbout:"Bhai Sahib was born on 10th August 1944 at village Bahuliana, Tehsil Chunni in district Lahore. He did his schooling in Abohar and then Giani in 1972 from Punjabi University, Patiala. Bhai Sewa Singh's native village is Tarmala in district Mukatsar, Punjab. In his early childhood he was inspired to imbibe Gurmat by his father S. Kundan Singh and mother Mata Ishar Kaur.<br><br>In 1978, he took Baptism \"Amrit\" at the inspiring persuasion of his close associate, Bhai Inderjit Singh Narangwal. His mother was spiritually inclined towards Naam Simran. The holy company of his mother and many other saintly souls laid the solid foundation of spirituality in his early life. With Akal Purkh's grace and through Naam Simran and Sabad-Surat practice, he became enlightened. He preaches and teaches union with Waheguru on the basis of the inspired and the revealed word of Gurbani. Preaching pure Gurmat, he explains techniques that lead to an ultimate union with Waheguru through Naam Simran. His wife Bibi Daljit Kaur is the source of inspiration behind this mission. Many other members of Bhai Sahib's family have been contributing towards the fulfillment of this noble mission.<br><br>By keeping such as great mission in mind and with the association of inspired Gurmukhs, Bhai Sahib established Sarab Sukh Charitable trust in 2005. Construction of Institute of Divine studies, Gurdwara Prabh Milne Ka Chao was started in Moga.<br><br>One year and four year courses were started in 2007. The purpose of the courses is to teach the students how to live their life by following Gurmat. By the grace of God and under the direction of a great quote from Gurbani \‚ÄúRecognise whole human race as of one caste,\‚Äù rays of enlightenment are spreading to each and every corner of the world by this Institute.",
